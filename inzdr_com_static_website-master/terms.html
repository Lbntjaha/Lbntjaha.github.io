Only one person may use the user name and password associated with a subscription account. You may be required to provide a current, valid, accepted method of payment ("Payment Method") to start your subscription or free trial. Paid subscriptions are offered either on a monthly or an annual basis ("Subscription Plan"). All subscriptions are renewed automatically on the renewal date of your Subscription Plan.

					3. Free Trial. From time to time, we may offer free trials of the subscription service for a specified period of time. Inzdr reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine your eligibility for a free trial, and to modify or withdraw a free trial at any time without notice or liability. We may require you to provide your Payment Method to start the free trial. On the first day after the free trial ends, we will begin billing your Payment Method for the subscription fee on a recurring basis, depending on your Subscription Plan, unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. However, we may authorize your Payment Method as soon as you register for a free trial.
