					<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
					<h2>What are cookies?</h2>
					<p>Cookies are used by most websites in order to improve users’ experience by enabling a website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally enable us to improve the performance of our website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. 
Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third party cookies’). 
You can find out more about the way cookies work on <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">www.cookiecentral.com.</a></p>
					<h2>What’s in a cookie?</h2>
					<p>A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website’s server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each cookie is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers.
					</p>
					<h2>Use of cookies on our website</h2>
					<p>We do not use ‘first party cookies’. We do use services that set cookies to your computer as ‘third party cookies’. <br>

					Third party cookies are:
					<ul class="blue-bullet b-cookies">
						<li><span>Analytical/performance cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. </span> </li>
						<li><span>Functionality cookies. These are used to recognise you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalise our content for you.</span></li>
						<li><span>Targeting cookies. These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. </span></li>					
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h2>How do third parties show adverts?</h2>
					<p>At times, third parties may show our adverts outside of our website. If you visit the site, having browsed content and then leave, third parties may ‘remember’ this visit and display a relevant advert within another website you visit. This process is commonly referred to as remarketing or retargeting.</p>
					<h2>How do third parties use cookies to serve adverts?</h2>
					<p>
						Third parties ‘remember’ you and can display adverts through cookies. Cookies may be sent to your browser when you visit a page on the site, which will then be used to show adverts based on the content you browsed.
					</p>
					<h2>What to do if you don’t want cookies to be set</h2>
					<p>
						Some people find the idea of a website storing information on their computer or mobile device a bit intrusive, particularly when this information is stored and used by a third party without them knowing.
If you prefer, it is possible to block some or all cookies or even to delete cookies that have already been set; although if you do this you may lose some of the website functionality and may not be served relevant adverts. If you don’t want to receive cookies, you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether. You can also delete cookies that have already been set. 
If you wish to restrict or block web browser cookies which are set on your device then you can do this through your browser settings. Click on the Help function within your browser to find out more. 
You can opt out of Google’s use of Cookies by amending your Google Ad settings: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">https://www.google.com/settings/ads.</a>
Please note, by turning off your personalisation across the web and on Google Search, you may still see adverts.
You can opt out of a third party’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.
Alternatively, you may wish to visit www.aboutcookies.org for further information.
