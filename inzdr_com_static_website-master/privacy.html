					<h1>iNZDR Privacy Policy</h1>
					<p>iNZDR IP S.A. ("inzdr") operates several apps and websites including inzdr App and www.inzdr.com. It is inzdr’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites and applications.</p>
					<h2>Website and services</h2>
					<p>Like most app and website and service operators, inzdr collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that App' and web browsers and servers typically make available. inzdr’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how inzdr’s visitors use its app and website and services. From time to time, inzdr may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. <br><br>

					inzdr also collects potentially personally-identifying information. This information is disclosed to the certain groups described below.
					</p>
					<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
					<p>Certain visitors to inzdr’s Apps and websites and services choose to interact with inzdr in ways that require inzdr to gather personally-identifying information. inzdr does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
					<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
					<p>inzdr may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its Apps and websites. inzdr may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, inzdr does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

					<p>inzdr discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on inzdr’s behalf or to provide services available at inzdr’s apps and websites and services, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using inzdr’s apps and websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. inzdr will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, inzdr discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when inzdr believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of inzdr, third parties or the public at large.  <br><br>
					If you are a registered user of a inzdr app, website or service and have supplied your email address, inzdr may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with inzdr and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. inzdr takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
